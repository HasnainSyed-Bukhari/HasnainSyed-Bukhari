👋 Hi, I’m Hasnain Shah <br>
👀 I’m interested in Artificial intelligence, Cybersecurity practices and web development.<br>
🌱 I’m currently learning Python Automation.<br>

⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that Python was named after the British comedy group Monty Python?<br>
    It’s a nod to their surreal and humorous style, even though Python itself is quite serious when it comes to programming! 🐍😄
